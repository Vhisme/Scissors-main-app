/* @tailwind base; how it was before i put the @import */

/* okay so i usually have an error here @tailwind base.. now with the use of import and the apparentices it has been normalised */
/* another way to go about this is to go to my settings, typed lint and at cssat unknown rules,i set it to ignore instad of warning */
/* so as long as it is a yellow line, it is just a warning and nothing serious about it so long it works. */
